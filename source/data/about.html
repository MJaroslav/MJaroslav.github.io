<p>
  I'm Yaroslav, also known as MJaroslav, a Java and Python developer. You might recognize me for my
  Minecraft
  Mods. My journey as a programmer began around 2013 when I started learning Pascal as part of my school
  program. Some time later, I developed an interest in creating my own modifications for Minecraft, which
  led
  me to self-learn Java. Additionally, I delved into creating chat bots for Discord and VK.

  Towards the end of my school years, I started learning Python, and a portion of my informatics exams was
  written in it. After completing school, I enrolled in college to pursue a career as a programmer.
  Throughout
  my academic years, I gained experience working with languages such as C++, C# (both desktop and web
  development), Java (specifically for Android development), and Python. For instance, my graduation
  project
  involved a back-end written in Python using the FastAPI framework.

  Following my college graduation, I pursued a C category driver's license and underwent military service
  until the end of 2023. Currently, I am focused on improving my English to an acceptable level (so I
  won't
  have to rely on a translator) and undertaking significant projects in the future.
